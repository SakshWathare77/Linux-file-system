Storage :

Linux has robust systems and tooling to manage hardware devices, including storage drives. 
how Linux represents these devices and how raw storage is made into usable space on the server.

Disk partition :
Disk partitions are a way of breaking up a storage drive into smaller usable units. 
A partition is a section of a storage drive that can be treated in much the same way as a drive itself.

MBR :
MBR is a special boot sector located at the beginning of a drive. 
This sector contains a boot loader for the installed operating system and 
information about the drive’s logical partitions. 
MBR does have its limitations. For starters, MBR only works with disks up to 2 TB in size.
MBR have maximum 26 partitions.

GPT :
GPT is called as GUID Partition Table because every partition on your drive has a “globally unique identifier,” or GUID—
a random string so long that every GPT partition on earth likely has its own unique identifier.
GPT doesn’t suffer from MBR’s limits.
GPT also allows for a nearly unlimited number of partitions. 
Maximun size for this is nearly 10TB and it have maximun 126 partitions.
On an MBR disk, the partitioning and boot data is stored in one place. If this data is overwritten or corrupted, you’re in trouble. 
In contrast, GPT stores multiple copies of this data across the disk, so it’s much more robust and can recover if the data is corrupted.
If the data is corrupted, GPT can notice the problem and attempt to recover the damaged data from another location on the disk. After extended partition, at the end GPT have backup of data to get the data.

How to create a partition:
  1. list partitions.
  2. label a partition.
  3. Use mkpart to make a partition.
  4. let the partition be created/settle.
  5. Attach the file system to the partition.
  6. Create a Mount point directory.
  7. Add entry in fstab.
  8. Systemctl daemon-reload.
  9. Mount the partition on the directory.
 

Some commands :
  1.list block with UUID Lsblk                       - fs /dev/vdb
  2.list partitions                                  - parted -l
  3.make label to a partition                        - parted /dev/vdb mklabel msdos
  4.create a partition                               - mkpart
  5.wait till partition is registered successfully   - udevadm settle
  6.format file system with XFS file system          - mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1
  7.restart daemon service                           - systemctl daemon-reload
