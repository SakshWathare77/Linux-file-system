Hard Link :
A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. 
It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.

Soft Link :
A soft link (also known as Symbolic link) 
acts as a pointer or a reference to the file name. 
It does not access the data available in the original file. 
If the earlier file is deleted, the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.

command : 
ln : for creating hard link 
      (ex. ln mylink)
In -s : for creating soft link 
       ( ex. ln -s myfile )
