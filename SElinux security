Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.
 
*SELinux has three modes:
1. Enforcing:  SELinux policy is enforced. 
               SELinux denies access based on SELinux policy rules.
2. Permissive: SELinux policy is not enforced.
               SELinux does not deny access, but denials are logged for actions that would have been denied if running in enforcing mode.
3. Disabled:   SELinux is disabled.

*Important Security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) commands
1. getenforce : To see the current status of SELinux.
2. Setenforce : The current SELinux status can also be changed with the “setenforce” command .
