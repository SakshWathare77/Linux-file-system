Linux file ownership and permission :
1. Ownership -
2. Permission -

1. ownership:
Every file and directory on Linux system is assigned 3 types of owner, given below.
1.user
2.group
3.other

2. Permission :
Let us understand the Permission system on Linux.
Every file and directory in Linux system has following 3 permissions defined for all the 3 owners discussed above.

Read(R):
 This permission give you the authority to open and read a file. 
 Read permission on a directory gives you the ability to lists its content.

Write(W):
 The write permission gives you the authority to modify the contents of a file. 
 The write permission on a directory gives you the authority to add, remove and rename files stored in the directory. 
 Consider a scenario where you have to write permission on file but do not have write permission on the directory where the file is stored. 
 You will be able to modify the file contents. But you will not be able to rename, move or remove the file from the directory.

Execute(X):
 In Windows, an executable program usually has an extension ".exe" and which you can easily run. 
 Linux, you cannot run a program unless the execute permission is set. 
 If the execute permission is not set, you might still be able to see/modify the program code(provided read & write permissions are set), but not run it.

 *The characters are pretty easy to remember:
  r = read permission
  w = write permission
  x = execute permission
  - = no permission
---------------------------------------------------- 
        (ex. -rw-rw-r-- )
Here ,

The first part of the code is 'rw-'. This suggests that the owner can:
* Read the file
* Write or edit the file
He cannot execute the file since the execute bit is set to '-'.

The second part is 'rw-'. It for the user group and group-members can:
* Read the file
* Write or edit the file

The third part is for the world which means any user. It says 'r--'. This means the user can only:
*Read the file
--------------------------------------------------------
* permission:      
  Read       =  4
  Write      =  2
  Execute    =  1

the following table show number of all permission type. :

-------------------------------------------------------- 
number.       symbols.       permission type.           
0.             ---             no permission
1.             --X             execute
2.             -W-             write      
3.             -WX             write + execute
4.             R--             Read
5.             R-X             Read + execute
6.             RW-             Read + write
7.             RWX             Read + write + excute
-------------------------------------------------------

            (ex. 764)

      * Owner can read, write and execute
      * Usergroup can read and write
      * World can only read
    (This is shown as '-rwxrw-r--)


*Commands :
1. chown :
"change owner" and is used to change the owner of a file.
In case you want to change the user as well as group for a file or directory use the command
(chown user : group filename)

2. chgrp : To change group and is used to change the group of a file.

3. chmod : To change the file or the directory permissions, you use the change mode command.
